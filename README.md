# GE2019 Postal Vote Data

There has been some interest in postal vote data from the General Election in December 2019 so I started compiling some of it via FOI requests. It's far from complete but I'm publishing it in case it is of use to any researchers or other interested people or in case people want to help compiling it. Some of the data is messy and hard to process. I've done my best with compiling this but it's a work in progress and I don't make any guarantees that its free of errors. I welcome contributions from anyone that wants to help by adding or checking data.

## Want to help?
If you have any of the missing data, feel free to add it. If you would like to help gather some of the missing data, then you can do so by submitting FOI requests to the relevant authority. This can be done as follows:

1. Check the data in the CSV file to see what data is missing - to avoid making duplicate requests or asking for data we already have. Let's not submit multiple requests to the same authorities.  
2. Find the Freedom of Information email address or form on the website of the relevant council or authority.
3. Submit a FOI request (template email below).
4. (IMPORTANT) Edit the CSV file (by clicking on the pencil icon). Change the status of that constituency to "Asked" and submit the change. 
5. When you receive a response, edit the CSV file again to add the missing data and submit another change.


## FOI request email template
Here is a template for a Freedom of Information email:

> I would like to make an FOI request for voter data from the 12th December 2019 General Election. Specifically, I would like the following info:
> 
> 1) Name of constituency
> 2) How many people were registered to vote by post in the constituency?
> 3) How many postal votes were received?
> 4) How many postal votes were marked as invalid due to the signature or DOB on the envelope?
> 5) How many postal votes were marked as invalid due to problems with the ballot papers?
> 6) What was the result of the postal vote by party?
> 
> In the case that your office administers more than one constituency, I would like the above information for each of the constituencies you administer.
> 
> I look forward to your reply.

## Notes on the questions
1 - The local authorities don't match up one-for-one with the voting constituencies. Some authorities have voting data for more than one and some seem to have partial data for a constituency. This question is to make it easier to match up.
4 & 5 - I had asked these as a single question in my original FOI batch, but some people provided one or the other or both. This is probably a better way to ask. 
6 - Most authorities won't have this info, but some seem to. If they provide it, please get in touch so we can figure out what to do with that data.
