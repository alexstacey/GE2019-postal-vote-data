# GE2019 Postal Vote Data

Note: This isn't being worked on any more. If you want to build on the data, just fork this repo and go ahead.  

There has been some interest in postal vote data from the General Election in December 2019 so I started compiling some of it via Freedom Of Information requests. It's far from complete (there's data for about 160 of the 650 constituencies currently) but I'm publishing it in case it is of use to any researchers or other interested people or in case people want to help compiling it. Some of the data is messy and hard to process. I've done my best but it's a work in progress and I don't make any guarantees that it's free of errors. I welcome contributions from anyone that wants to help by adding or checking data.
